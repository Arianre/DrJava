Internet Service provider

An Internet service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:

Package A: For $9.95 per month 10 hours of access are provided. Additional hours are $2.00 per hour. Package B: For $13.95 per month 20 hours of access are provided. Additional hours are $1.00 per hour. Package C: For $19.95 per month unlimited access is provided.

Write a program that calculates a customer’s monthly bill. It should ask the user to enter the letter of the package the customer has purchased (A, B, or C) and the number of hours that were used. It should then display the total charges.

your mimir File  name must be: InternetServiceProvider.java

 

Test Case1:

Enter the letter of the package purchased: 
A
Enter the number of hours that were used: 
20
Your total charges are $29.95

Test Case2:

Enter the letter of the package purchased: 
b
Enter the number of hours that were used: 
10
Your total charges are $13.95

Test Case3:

Enter the letter of the package purchased: 
C
Enter the number of hours that were used: 
20
Your total charges are $19.95

Test Case4:

Enter the letter of the package purchased: 
D
Enter the number of hours that were used: 
20
That package input was not an option.

 Please Study line by line dont just copy the code
